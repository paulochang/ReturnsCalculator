# ReturnsCalculator
This project aims to create a really simple stock and portfolio return calculator

An SQLite database is used to store the stock, portfolio and pricing information.
Pricing information is assumed to be comming on a minute basis.

A table is used to store the return for every minute, hour and day of each stock.
Porfolio returns are initially calculated based on pricing information.
